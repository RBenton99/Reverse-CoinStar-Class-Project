# Reverse-CoinStar-Class-Project
The is the second project assignment in my CS 231.
It acts as the sister project to the first, except it teaches some concepts taht need to be applied to reverse the earlier process.
The main purpose of this project was to calculate change from a double type input from the prompted user.
The first bit of code was the declarations of the variables that I would be using.
We use X as a double because the input we were looking for was a certain amount of money in dollars and cents.
The Y was declared as an int due to the first thing we due after the user inputs, is we multiplyd the amount by 100 to get rid of the decimal so it could be processed into cent form.
The next bit was the process of shaving down and giving change in the lowest forms.
So the program would take your value and see the most amount of the type it was on to maximize change values.
The coding here was reflected in dividing Y by the amount it was computing, and then reserving the rest of the value to be transferred to the next part, shown by the "y=y%" function.
It was given the purpose of breaking down the total and giving the user the least amount of change in each category, this time with dollars included.
As the calculation is made for each coin the total is sent out to the user in a message, in the format of "You will need Y amount of X".
A simple program that compares to the first and introduces new functions the % function that helped retain the value and make the program work.
